            Worcester Civic Society believes that Worcester has a proud history, with many firsts and innovations in arts and industry, and also possesses an impressive and unique natural and built environment.<br /><br />
            We provide a meeting place for all who are concerned with the quality of life in the City of Worcester, where they may live, work, study or visit. Through a varied programme of events we help to inform and entertain members and create opportunities for discussion, particularly on matters affecting the City's development and presentation.
            <br /><br />
            Worcester Civic Society, founded in 1959, was born out of the 1950’s recognition of the threat to the historic fabric of our cities and towns, in the wake of wartime devastation and the frenetic efforts to repair its damage and modernise the urban landscape.
            <br /><br />
            In the intervening 50 years, we have come to see the historic environment as more and more important. In Worcester, despite the ravages of the 1970s, we still have a wealth of important buildings in the city’s historic core and beyond. The need for the Society to work with the City and County Councils to ensure that the best is made of this inheritance remains as important as ever.
            <br /><br />
            Through a varied programme of events we help to inform and entertain members and create opportunities for discussion, particularly on matters affecting the City’s development and presentation. We produce a regular newsletter covering its activities and matters of interest and debate locally and nationally.
