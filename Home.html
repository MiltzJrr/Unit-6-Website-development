        <p>Worcester Civic Society recognises that Worcester's proud historical legacy needs to be developed and enhanced, but without strong vision and leadership, opportunities to do this may be squandered, and the city could become a 'nearly' city or a mere 'suburban satellite' in an expanded West Midlands conurbation. The City must embrace future trends and changes, but must also carefully guide these to ensure that new developments are sustainable in the long-term and also enhance the unique character and distinctiveness of the city. </p>

        <p>Therefore, we aim to:</p>
        <p>
            Be a 'champion' for the environment of the City of Worcester.
            <br />
            Contribute to the development of 'civic pride' in the City of Worcester.
            Contribute to Worcester's development as a first-class Cathedral and University City.
            Ensure that the future of Worcester's built and natural environment is widely debated amongst the citizens of the city, and that these debates underpin a clear vision for the city, that is shared by all and that is promoted by the city's leaders.
